### Check the URLs for the Supply Chain Dashboard in your Power Apps

The last step is to add your URL for your PowerBI report into the Power Apps and republish it/play it. 

Edit your Power Apps:

On the Home Page button, you have to click on the View PBI dashboard. Go grab the URL for your Power BI Report and put update the existing URL for your Power BI dashboard.


Change the URL with the correct one, refresh the Power Apps and publish it again.
