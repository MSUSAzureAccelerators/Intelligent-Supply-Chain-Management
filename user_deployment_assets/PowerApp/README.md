> **Note**
> Estimated time to complete the steps ~ 10 minutes

In this guide, you will install and deploy the Supply Chain Power App developed for this Solution Accelerator. We assume you have a Power App license. You will also need access to a Premium license for creating SQL connections.

### 10.1 Create an Azure SQL connection in your Power Apps envrironment, to connect to your Azure SQL database.    

The Supply Chain Power Apps connects to the Azure SQL database and allows you to change, modify, remove the simulation parameters in the table called [sc_params]. To enable this connection, you will have to create a new SQL connection and select it when you import the Supply Chain Power App. 

> Check this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwxRcp1KIwA) for how to create a new SQL connection in your Power App subscription.

### 10.2 Import a Canvas App 

Go to https://make.preview.powerapps.com/ and get ready to import the Supply Chain Power App provided in this github repository. 

> Check this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYZEmCedSr8) to see steps to deploy a generic Power App, and repeat the steps using the canvas App in this folder.

After completing these steps, you'll be ready to use the Power Apps to launch your simulations :)
